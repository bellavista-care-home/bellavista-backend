      fullDescription: `We dedicated the day to remembering those that so courageously fought and gave their lives to our country. It was held in the care home's main lounge, which were specially decorated with poppies to commemorate the event. Residents shared their war time memories, we decorated the home with remembrance themed displays, had a minute's silence, shared memories and stories of world war 2 and a lovely concert from music care dedicated victory songs for our amazing residents then we ended the day with an afternoon tea with a war time music. All the staff was honoured to organise such a tribute to the men and women who gave everything to the country so that we can have the lives we live today.`,
